    "about": "Interactive 3D model of the input 2D heart. Instead of relying on flat 2D images, users can explore a fully interactive 3D representation of the heart. This provides doctors and patients with a clearer, more intuitive understanding of the condition.\nMulti-classification of CHD categories. The model identifies the most likely congenital heart disease (CHD) categories based on the uploaded scan, helping users understand potential diagnoses.\nSeverity Classification. Users can also view how serious their CHD symptoms are.\nModel Confidence. We understand that AI may not always be correct, so a confidence score is included in the web application to guide a doctor’s conclusion with the AI findings.\nFeedback Form. For doctors, we have a space for them to accept or reject the model’s findings and explain their reasonings. This will help better fine-tune the model and ensure continuous improvement in its accuracy and reliability for diagnosing CHD conditions.\nAI Voice Chat. Guided by the previous datapoints, the AI voice chat is ready to discuss with the user any questions they have about the model's output and reasoning.\nCustom Heart Segmentation Model Currently, CMRI segmentation is performed manually to ensure accuracy. To automate this process, we developed a custom segmentation model trained on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using Brev Compute. While the model requires additional data and refinement for full accuracy, it successfully identified regions of interest despite the limited training dataset. Our architecture is specifically designed for cardiac imaging, labeling 3D volumes into eight major heart structures (four chambers and four arteries/veins). With further data and training, we aim to eliminate the need for manual segmentation in the pipeline.",

An embedded sensor continuously monitors foot temperature, ensuring the system responds in real time to thermal needs. AI-powered analyses of temperature data alongside health metrics (e.g., activity levels, medical conditions) help predict and preemptively adjust stimuli responses, optimizing comfort and performance. Therms also connects to APIs (Terra, Scrapybara, OpenAI) to incorporate additional physiological data, such as heart rate, sleep patterns, and chronic conditions. This enables personalized thermoregulation strategies and early detection of anomalies. For example, if a diabetic user’s foot temperature rises abnormally, Therms can cool the area to prevent tissue damage and AUTOMATICALLY book an appointment with a healthcare professional.",

Lemon offers a fully transparent shopping experience; each product is listed with details about its source, and the user has full control over when and what products they buy, like traditional online grocery stores. Producers (farmers) can create listings for their surplus or \"wonky\" produce, allowing them to sell items that are perfectly good but not deemed aesthetically pleasing enough for traditional markets. Businesses can also shop for discounted produce like customers, but Lemon offers business accounts additional support by enabling them to request in bulk, advertise to nearby users and and form long-term partnerships with local farmers. Lemon’s goal is to raise awareness about the impact of food waste, making it easier for everyone to make sustainable shopping choices and contribute to a greener, more connected world.",

So, we leverage web scraping, machine learning, and AI agents to find these discrepancies. We take pictures of a person and their ID using the Meta Ray Bans glasses, process this information, and utilize agents to crawl the internet and verify the validity of the ID. We have a web UI where a user can view the results of our search, which include a face-matching confidence score, address, age, and other identifying information. Our project uses a multitude of strategies to achieve this goal. We built a web scraper to perform reverse image searching. We leverage Perplexity’s Sonar and other online sources to validate the person’s name, age, and address. At the end of this workflow, Identity AI presents results to the user, who will then know the validity of an ID regardless of its quality.",

Using data from pre-your own wearables and biometric sensors embedded within the garment, it continuously monitors physiological indicators like heart rate variability, skin temperature, and breathing patterns. When it detects signs of anxiety—such as an elevated heart rate or erratic breathing—Haven automatically activates its built-in therapeutic mechanisms. These include deep pressure stimulation, mimicking the calming effect of a weighted blanket, and vibration therapy, which provides soothing rhythmic pulses to help regulate stress responses. All of this happens seamlessly, without the need for user intervention, allowing wearers to manage their anxiety discreetly and effortlessly.",

The current version of the design includes just a bare minimum number of variables to fill out in each of the first two cases: a title for searching and bookkeeping, a distance metric to quantitatively gauge an individual's interest in traveling for the good or service, a category selection menu for filtering, and a description field. While most forms tend to leave this part optional, I intended for it to be required because it is the user's opportunity to tell a story about what they're offering, or if they're not feeling particularly talkative, they can opt to say something more light-hearted that can maybe brighten someone else's day. If an offer is submitted, it goes immediately into the database, and if a request is submitted, it immediately returns a select few items from the database that may be of interest to the user.",
